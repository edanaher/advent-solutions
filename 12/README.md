This one might want a bit of explanation - JSON parsing to pull out things that don't include red is nontrivial.  But since there are no annoying things like spaces in the input, searching for :"red" and deleting everything inside the enclosing braces suffices.  Unfortunatly, matches braces is not something most tools make easy.  But vim does!

So I just "manually" editted the file in vim; the sol.12b.vim is the keystrokes I used to do so.
