Advent of Code Solutions
========================

These are some fun solutions to [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/).  So far (day 3), the .sh ones are
my initial solutions (shell script "one-liners"), and the .sed ones are me having fun writing in pure sed; run
those with
```bash
cat input | sed -f sol.__.sed
```
