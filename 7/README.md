Blech...  I resorted to Ruby, and this is quick and dirty.  Run it through head -n1000 or so to let it converge.  And for part b, just change the input file to assign it to b, and rerun.

And this was an attempt to be as quick as possible; the problem wasn't quite ugly enough to justify time spent on niceties like mapping names to functions or cleanly handling single-operand operations.

I'll likely do a cleaner version in awk, but this was probably faster.
